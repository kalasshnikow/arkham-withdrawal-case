# Arkham Exchange — “Location Not Allowed” After KYC Approved  
**Case file & evidence pack** for withdrawals blocked on Arkham Exchange (arkm.com)

> **Summary:**  
> I registered at **Arkham Exchange** in **January 2025**, passed **KYC (Russian passport)**, **no Proof of Address (PoA) was requested**, and **my deposit was accepted**.  
> On **2025-06-20** my withdrawals began failing with **“location not allowed.”**  
> After multiple tickets and formal emails (with deadlines), Arkham has not offered a workable path to withdraw my own funds (**0.560400 ETH + 2.984913 USDT**).

## Why this matters (for *any* user)
This is not a political post. I lived **outside Russia in Armenia from early 2022 through March 2025** and returned to Russia due to a **serious family illness**. The core issue here is **custody, process, and promises**:

- Arkham’s **Exchange ToS** state that **title to digital assets in your account remains with you** and that Arkham may **temporarily** suspend withdrawals to ensure compliance — that is not a license for open-ended retention. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- Arkham publicly announced on **2025-04-18** that onboarding was streamlined and **“proof of address is no longer required for the majority of users,”** which matches my onboarding experience (no PoA requested when the platform accepted my deposit). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

If an exchange can **take a deposit without PoA**, then months later **deny withdrawals** because you cannot produce a **fresh** PoA for a **former** residence, any traveler, expat, or remote worker can end up in the same trap.

## What I’m asking Arkham to do
I am **not** asking to restore trading from a non-permitted jurisdiction. I’m asking for the industry-standard, least-intrusive remedy that Arkham’s own ToS contemplate:

> **Enable withdrawal-only offboarding** to a self-custody address I own (I can cryptographically sign a message; whitelist as needed).

This aligns with:
- **Custody & Title** — “title remains with you,” assets are not Arkham’s property. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- The **temporary** nature of compliance holds (vs. open-ended). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Industry baselines** in sanctions-driven situations:  
  **Binance** placed affected users into **withdrawal-only** while restricting deposits/trading; **Kraken** and **Blockchain.com** restricted services **but allowed withdrawals / set deadlines**. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
