## What Arkham’s own documents say
- **Custody & Title** — “**Title to digital assets within your account remains with you at all times** … not our property … not subject to claims of our creditors” (**ToS §103–105**). :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- **Withdrawal** — Arkham **may suspend withdrawals** to ensure compliance (**ToS §109**), i.e., **temporary** measures — not open-ended retention. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- **Eligibility** — Arkham **does not permit onboarding** from certain jurisdictions (list includes **Russia**) and reserves the right to block access; this is exactly why the proportionate remedy is **withdrawal-only offboarding**, not months-long balance retention. :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}  
- **Arkham Update (2025-04-18)** — onboarding streamlined; **“PoA is no longer required for the majority of users.”** :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}

## Industry baseline (for comparison)
When residency restrictions tightened in 2022, reputable exchanges did **not** keep non-sanctioned users’ balances indefinitely due to residency alone — they allowed **withdrawals** or set **withdraw-by** deadlines:
- **Binance (2022-04-21, Reuters):** affected clients **would be able to withdraw funds** while deposits/trading were restricted. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- **Kraken (2022-10-20, The Block):** restrictions **with withdrawals allowed** (per client emails obtained by the outlet). :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  
- **Blockchain.com (2022-10-14, The Block):** users told to **withdraw by Oct 27** before custodial access would be blocked. :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}
